# Data Preparation
The data used in this dashboard was generated using `Mockaroo`, a random data generator. The raw data was then cleaned and processed using Python to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Steps Performed During Data Cleaning:**
- **Merging Data**: Combined `sales`, `menu`, and `customers` tables into a single dataset.
- **Date Conversion**: Converted the `order_date` column to a datetime format.
- **Total Price Calculation**: Calculated the `total_price` for each order by multiplying the price and quantity.
- **Data Validation**: Ensured data consistency (e.g., no negative sales values).

## Files Included:
**Raw Data**: The original data generated from Mockaroo is available in the `data/` folder:
- `sales.csv`
- `menu.csv`
- `customers.csv`

**Cleaned Data**: The processed and cleaned CSV file `(merged_sales_menu_customers.csv)` is available in the `data/` folder.

**Cleaning Code**: The Python script used for data cleaning is available in the `scripts/` folder.
## How to Run the Cleaning Code:
- Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```
- Run the Python script:
```bash
python scripts/
```
